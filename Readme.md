Environment Configuration

.env: Ensure this file contains the necessary environment variables such as API keys, paths to datasets, or configuration settings for your project. For example, you might store paths to your datasets or model checkpoints in this file for easy access across your scripts.
Integrating Symptoms & Age:

This folder appears to handle the integration of features such as symptoms and age into the prediction or classification model.
bert_trainer.py: This script is likely where you train a BERT-based model. Ensure that you handle data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation within this script.
Symptoms_Diagnosis_Report_dataset.py: This script might be responsible for managing the dataset that links symptoms to diagnoses and generating reports.
SecondDataset.py: This script likely processes another dataset or acts as an auxiliary for the main dataset. Make sure the preprocessing in this script aligns with the requirements of the primary dataset.
Synthetic Data:

dataset/: This is where your synthetic and real datasets will be stored.
You can generate synthetic data (combining symptoms and diagnoses) in the dataset/ folder if you are simulating different conditions or augmenting your dataset. Ensure the synthetic data mimics the real-world distribution of symptoms and diagnoses.
model/: This folder could store your models, either the pre-trained ones or the ones you develop. Make sure your models are saved with clear names indicating the experiment or approach used.
LLM-based Report Generation:

This directory seems focused on generating reports using a large language model (LLM).
Depending on your implementation, you may need to integrate an API or library (like GPT) for report generation, depending on your goal. If using a transformer-based model for report generation, consider saving the models and checkpoints here.
Pneumonia Prediction:

This section seems dedicated to the core functionality of predicting pneumonia from X-ray images.
Ensure your data pipeline and model architecture are aligned to handle image data for training and testing. The model should focus on distinguishing between normal and pneumonia X-rays.
Dataset:

The dataset is categorized into train, test, and validation folders, which is great for model training, evaluation, and testing.
Make sure that images in the respective folders are labeled correctly (e.g., NORMAL, PNEUMONIA).
Mini datasets (valid-mini) are helpful for quick model checks but ensure they are representative of the full dataset for validation.
Model Trained:

This folder holds the trained model, specifically the chest_xray_model.pth.
After training the model, save it in this folder and load it during evaluation or inference for testing predictions on new X-ray images.
Source Code:

dataloader.py: This script will handle loading and preprocessing image data from the dataset. Ensure you use a robust data augmentation pipeline to improve model generalization.
evaluate_model.py: After training, this script can be used to evaluate the model on test or validation data. It could include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
train_model.py: This is the core script for training the pneumonia prediction model. Make sure to define the architecture (e.g., CNN, ResNet) and training pipeline (loss function, optimizer, etc.) here.
Test Images:

The Test_JPG/ folder holds test images you can use to evaluate the model in real-time or during post-training validation. Ensure these images are correctly labeled and preprocessed to match the model's input requirements.
Readme.md:

The Readme.md file should outline the purpose of your project, how to set up the environment, dependencies, and how to use the different components (e.g., training, testing, evaluation). It should also provide any other relevant information for collaborators or users.
requirements.txt:

This file lists all the dependencies your project requires. Ensure you list packages like torch, torchvision, pandas, scikit-learn, and any other libraries essential for your model and data processing.
